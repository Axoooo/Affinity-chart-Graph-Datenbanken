# Characters-chart-Graph-Datenbanken

## Beschreibung des Projects

In this Project we are doing a Character-chart for characters from the game Xenoblade Chronicles 3. We use the graph database for showing relations beetween the character.
But also what role they have in a fight and for what Nation they fight for or even rule over.

## Fazit

Geben Sie uns eine 6 please, danke!

It was something new for the both of us however the instalation worked great. But we often debated how to do something because we both understood something else.

Robin:

It was confusing at first but it made more sense the more I worked with it.

Tim:

I liked it way better than mongoDB and I'm kind of dissapointed that we didn't work more on neo4j / graph databases.
However there was one thing that really made me mad about neo4j and it's making a backup because I didn't manage to do that. It was so much easier on the mongoDB.
