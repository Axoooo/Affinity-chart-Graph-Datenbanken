# Characters-chart-Graph-Datenbanken

## Beschreibung des Projects

In this Project are we doing a Character-chart for characters in a game we like. We use the Graph-Datebase for showing realtions beetween the character. But also what role they have in a fight and for what Nation they fight for or even reign over.
